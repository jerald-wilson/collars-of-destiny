Game made in Godot with GDScript (fun lightweight language similar to Python)

Game idea:

Fast paced vertical platformer with a ninja cat protagonist. Magical collars can be found which grant magical abilities to the cat.

The action should feel fast as you're blazing a path upwards through the map. This is not a stealthy ninja game but a loud and comical cat fight. Beverly Hills Ninja - the cat version.
